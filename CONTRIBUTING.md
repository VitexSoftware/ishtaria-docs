# Contributing to ishtaria-docs

Thank you. ishtaria-docs is the documentation: architecture, decisions, development and operations (Sphinx, reStructuredText).

1. Read the [developer guide](https://github.com/VitexSoftware/ishtaria-docs/tree/main/source/development): `invariants` (short, binding), `local-setup`, `cookbook`.
2. Open an issue for anything larger than a fix; architectural changes are written as a decision record first.
3. Make a small change with a test that fails without it (also for the refusal paths) and run the checks:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt   # and graphviz
   make html                          # warnings are errors
   ```

4. Use Conventional Commits (`feat(ishtaria-docs): ...`), branch from `main`, and fill in the pull request template:
   what you tested, what you could not test, what is still planned.

Working with Claude Code is welcome and expected: `CLAUDE.md` in this repository is read automatically. You are
responsible for the code you submit; read the diff, especially SQL, locking, validation and every place a client
value reaches a server.
