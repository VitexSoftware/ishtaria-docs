Configuration
=============

``/etc/ishtaria/server.toml``

.. code-block:: toml

   # DNS name of this world; becomes part of every player and item id.
   server_name = "ishtaria.example.org"
   # Rules shared with federated worlds (must match peers' major version).
   ruleset = "core-rules@1.0"
   listen = "0.0.0.0:7400"

.. warning::

   ``server_name`` is permanent. Player ids (``@user:server``) and item ids
   (``server/uuid``) embed it, so changing it later breaks identities and
   federation. Choose a domain you will keep.

Limits, logs and metrics
------------------------

An optional ``[limits]`` table protects a public server. Every key has a default that suits a
small public world, and the guard is a plain middleware without further dependencies.

.. code-block:: toml

   [limits]
   auth_per_minute = 10          # registrations and logins per minute from one address
   requests_per_second = 100     # sustained requests per second from one address ...
   burst = 300                   # ... and the burst allowed on top of it
   trust_proxy = false           # true only behind your own reverse proxy
   access_log = "errors"         # "errors", "all" or "off"
   metrics_token = "long-random" # lets a remote scraper read /metrics

* Limits are kept per client address in memory (a restart forgets them). Players behind one address
  (a school, a family, a mobile network) share it: raise ``requests_per_second`` and ``burst`` for such a
  world. A walking client sends about ten requests per second.
* ``trust_proxy = true`` takes the address from the **last** entry of ``X-Forwarded-For``, the one your own
  proxy added. Never set it on a server that clients reach directly, or anybody can pretend to be anybody.
* A refused request gets ``429`` with ``Retry-After``. Every request has a 30 s time limit (``504``).
* ``/metrics`` answers loopback only (and not at all behind ``trust_proxy``), or a request with
  ``Authorization: Bearer <metrics_token>``. See :doc:`monitoring`.

Federation agreements
---------------------

Agreements live in ``/etc/ishtaria/federation/<peer>.yaml`` and follow the
schema in :doc:`../federation/agreement`. Validate before reloading:

.. code-block:: sh

   python3 -m jsonschema \
     -i /etc/ishtaria/federation/svet-b.example.org.yaml \
     /usr/share/ishtaria/protocol/schemas/federation-agreement.schema.json

.. todo:: Federation loading is not implemented yet (milestone M4).
