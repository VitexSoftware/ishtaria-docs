Tour of the server code
=======================

``ishtaria-server`` is one Rust binary (axum, SQLx, PostgreSQL). Every gameplay area is a module
with its own ``routes()`` that ``src/main.rs`` merges into the router, a SQL migration for its tables
and, where the content is data, a file in ``etc/``.

How a request is handled
------------------------

A typical action (``POST /players/me/...``) always does the same things in the same order:

#. ``players::player_id(&state, &players::token_hash(&headers)?)`` turns the bearer token into a
   character id (expired, revoked, dead and banned sessions are refused with 401).
#. The request body is parsed into a struct with ``#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`` and validated.
#. A transaction starts and ``survival::lock_alive`` locks the character's row. If the character is
   dead the handler returns ``Error::Obituary``.
#. The handler checks position, reach, cooldown and ownership, changes tables and commits, or
   returns an ``Error::Status(code, "fixed message")`` that rolls everything back.
#. The reply is usually ``players::profile(&state, player_id)`` so that the client's HUD and
   inventory are always in step.

Data files (``etc/``)
---------------------

Rules that a designer may change without writing Rust are JSON or YAML compiled into the binary
(``include_str!``) and parsed once at first use; a unit test in the owning module checks that the
file is consistent, and ``configured_items_exist`` checks that every item it names is in the
catalogue. To add one, see :doc:`cookbook`.

.. list-table::

     - Content
   * - ``recipes.json``

Tests
-----

``src/tests.rs`` holds the shared helpers (``initialize_spawn_world``, ``create_session``,
``player_request``, ``response_json``) and ``src/tests/*.rs`` one file per gameplay area. A test that
needs PostgreSQL is ``#[sqlx::test]`` and ``#[ignore]``; take ``AUTH_TESTS`` so that tests which
register players do not interleave. Look at ``src/tests/trade.rs`` for a test with two players and at
``src/tests/farming.rs`` for one that needs a different world.
