Tour of the client code
=======================

``ishtaria-client`` is a Godot 4.5 project that builds almost all of its interface in code. There is one
scene (``scenes/main.tscn``); ``scripts/main.gd`` creates every node, wires the signals and handles input.

Principles
----------

* **The client shows and asks; it does not decide.** Every ``*_client.gd`` and ``player_session.gd``
  is a thin HTTP layer that sends an intention and emits a signal with a *validated* answer.
* **Validate every answer.** Each client has static ``valid_*`` functions that check type, shape and
  range; what does not pass is dropped. They are the first thing to test.
* **Refusals are message keys.** Map the server's fixed error text to a translatable key in a static
  ``error_key`` function; never show server text.
* **A generation counter guards requests.** Each client increments ``_generation`` in ``stop()`` and
  ignores answers that belong to an earlier connection, so a late answer never changes a newly chosen
  server.
* **English is the source, Czech a translation** (``locales/client.csv``; add every new text key there).

Keys that are reserved
----------------------

``character_controls.RESERVED_KEYS`` lists keys the player cannot rebind for walking. When you
add a key to ``main.gd:_input``, add it there too.

Tests
-----

``tests/*.gd`` are ``SceneTree`` scripts started with ``godot4 --headless --script``; each has a
``make test-...`` target. A check calls ``_check(ok, "what")``, the script prints ``... passed``
and ``quit(1)`` on a failure. An error *inside* an ``await`` kills the script without ``quit``
and the run hangs: if a test seems to hang, run it with ``timeout`` and look for a script error.
