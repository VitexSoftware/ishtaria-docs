Roadmap
=======

Each milestone produces something that can be installed and played or
operated on its own.

Where we are (October 2026)
---------------------------

The base game exists and is tested: walking on a generated planet, survival, gathering, crafting at
stations, hunting with armour and creatures that bite back, merchants and exchanges between players,
building, farming, fishing, nearby players with text chat, magic, graves and permanent death, story
datadisks, portals and share links between worlds. A public server can be limited, observed and backed
up, and a contributor can extend the game with the :doc:`developer guide <development/contributing>`.
M1 is done. Parts of M2 (day and night, animals) and M3 (inventories, merchants, exchanges between
players) exist, but the seasons, the cell-level ecosystem, player-made currencies and the double-entry
ledger are still open, as are M4 to M7 in their full scope. The newest open work is listed in M7a to M9.

   * - #
     - Milestone
     - Scope
   * - M0
     - Foundations
     - Repositories, Debian packaging, CI, documentation, identifiers and
       ruleset versions in ``ishtaria-core``, cube-sphere generator.
   * - M1
     - Single world, single biome
     - Authoritative server, client connects and walks on generated
       terrain, gathering and primitive crafting, persistence of deltas.
   * - M2
     - Living world
     - Simulation levels of detail, cell-level ecosystem, offline avatars,
       day/night and seasons.
   * - M3
     - Economy
     - Inventories, barter, player-made currency, double-entry ledger.
   * - M4
     - Federation: avatars
     - ``@user:server`` identities, server keys, portals carrying avatar
       and cosmetics only.
   * - M5
     - Federation: items
     - Item provenance, import/export policies, two-phase handover.
   * - M6
     - Federation: currencies
     - Exchange between world currencies with caps.
   * - M7a
     - Content without recompiling
     - The next, smaller step towards M7. Rules that are data today (recipes, spells, shops,
       crops, creatures) are read from a content directory or a datadisk instead of being compiled into
       the server, and items can be defined by data instead of by a migration. Needs a decision
       record for the item catalogue (it is in the database now), validation of foreign content, and
       a way to ship the matching icons and models.
   * - M7
     - Custom content
     - Hash-addressed content packs, fallbacks for unknown kinds,
       sandboxed WASM server logic.
   * - M8
     - Community and visibility
     - Achievements and share links for social networks
       (:doc:`decisions/0011-sharing-achievements`), memorial and hall of
       fame pages, a showcase on the web portal, the chronicle of a world,
       creator tools, a press kit with screenshots and a trailer made from the real client. Supported by a developer guide
       (:doc:`development/contributing`) and a hardened, observable server
       (:doc:`operations/hardening`).
   * - M9
     - Complete the base game
     - What players of today expect and the game still lacks: skills instead of a single experience
       level, a hotbar, a minimap, weather and sleeping in a bed, a tutorial for new players, graphics
       and accessibility settings. Open design questions: player versus player, animals that chase,
       protection of leased land, collision of placed things.
